        "title": "The Problem & Our Solution",
        "text": "The Problem & Our Solution The world of token launches is filled with opportunity, but it's also fraught with challenges. For too long, both project creators and investors have navigated a landscape that lacks transparency, security, and adequate support. Kadpad was born from a desire to fix this broken system. The Problem: A Broken Launchpad Model Traditional launchpads and fundraising platforms often fail to serve the best interests of their communities, leading to a cycle of mistrust and missed potential. Lack of Transparency & Trust:  Many platforms operate as \"black boxes,\" providing little insight into their vetting processes or the true potential of the projects they feature. This ambiguity creates an environment where scams and low-quality projects can proliferate, leaving investors vulnerable. High Barriers to Entry:  Getting a project featured on a major launchpad can be prohibitively difficult for emerging teams. Likewise, investors are often priced out of private sales or face unfair allocation models, concentrating opportunities in the hands of a select few. Insufficient Post-Launch Support:  A successful launch is just the beginning. Too many platforms abandon projects immediately after the fundraising concludes, leaving them without the strategic guidance, liquidity support, and community management needed to achieve long-term growth. Inadequate Security:  Many launchpads are built on less secure infrastructure, exposing projects and investors to significant technical and financial risks. This fundamental weakness undermines the entire ecosystem. Our Solution: A New Standard for Token Launches Kadpad directly confronts these challenges with a comprehensive, transparent, and secure solution built to empower the entire Kadena ecosystem. Unwavering Security & Trust:  We are built on Kadena, the industry's only scalable layer-1 Proof-of-Work blockchain. Every project undergoes a rigorous audit and must adhere to our  “Kadpad Absolute Zero”  trust model, which mandates full team transparency, locked liquidity, and clear tokenomics. This ensures that only legitimate, high-quality projects reach our community. Fair & Accessible Opportunities:  We believe in democratizing access to innovation. Our platform provides a clear and attainable pathway for promising projects to launch. For investors, our native token staking system ensures fair and transparent access to private sale allocations, leveling the playing field for all community members. End-to-End Strategic Partnership:  We are more than a platform; we are a partner. We provide projects with dedicated support from incubation to post-launch, including tokenomic design, marketing strategy, and community-building initiatives. Our success is tied to the long-term success of the projects we launch. A Community-Centric Ecosystem:  Kadpad is designed to foster a powerful and engaged community. By providing transparent information, educational resources, and direct lines of communication with project teams, we empower our members to become active, informed participants in the growth of the Kadena ecosystem."

        "text": "Key Features & Strategic Partnerships Kadpad is engineered with a suite of powerful features and fortified by strategic alliances to create the most secure, effective, and user-friendly launchpad in the Kadena ecosystem. Every element is designed to maximize project success and deliver unparalleled value to our community. Key Features Our platform integrates cutting-edge solutions to address the core needs of both project creators and investors. Built on Kadena:  Kadpad is natively built on Kadena’s infinitely scalable, layer-1 Proof-of-Work blockchain. This provides an institutional-grade security foundation for all operations, protecting projects and investors from the vulnerabilities common on other platforms. The “Kadpad Absolute Zero” Trust Model:  This is our flagship security protocol, designed to eliminate risk and protect our community's investments. Our policies are non-negotiable. Before any project can launch, it must agree to our strict terms and conditions, which include: Mandatory Team KYC:  The entire project team must pass a comprehensive Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process. Rigorous Project & Tokenomic Audit:  We conduct a full audit of the project's code and a thorough review of its tokenomics to ensure viability and fairness. Locked Community Funds:  To prevent \"rug pulls,\" all $KDA raised during the launch is immediately locked as liquidity within the Mercatus decentralized exchange. These are community funds, and we ensure they are used to kickstart the project as intended. Locked Unsold Tokens:  Any tokens remaining unsold after the launch are also locked within the Mercatus DEX, preventing them from being dumped on the market and protecting the value for early investors. Guaranteed & Tiered Allocations via Staking:  We provide fair and guaranteed access to private sales through our native $KPAD token. By staking $KPAD, community members enter a tiered system that determines their allocation size. This model rewards loyalty and ensures that every participant has a clear path to entry, removing the uncertainty of lottery-based systems. End-to-End Project Support:  We function as a long-term strategic partner, not just a fundraising platform. Our team provides comprehensive support throughout a project's lifecycle, including pre-launch tokenomic design, marketing strategy, and post-launch community management and advisory to ensure sustainable growth. Strategic Partnership: The TokenGo Alliance Our success is amplified by our cornerstone partnership with TokenGo, the premier tokenization service provider. This alliance creates a seamless, end-to-end pipeline for project success, powered by the unmatched technical advantages of the Kadena blockchain. A Complete Ecosystem Solution:  The TokenGo Alliance provides an all-in-one solution that is unmatched in the industry. From initial concept and token creation with TokenGo to a successful launch on Kadpad and post-launch growth strategies, we ensure projects are fundamentally sound and ready for the market before they ever reach our community. Unparalleled Security & Integrity:  Our shared infrastructure leverages Kadena's proven Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, ensuring the unwavering integrity of all token launches. We employ state-of-the-art security, including advanced encryption and stringent access controls, to comprehensively safeguard user data and project assets. Superior Scalability & Efficiency:  Kadena's innovative Chainweb technology provides a highly scalable architecture, empowering Kadpad to facilitate exceptionally efficient and seamless token sales, even during peak demand. This inherent scalability also significantly reduces transaction costs, making the entire launch process more accessible and economically viable for everyone involved. Powerful Synergies:  KadPad and TokenGo are designed to operate in powerful synergy. By sharing the robust infrastructure and enhanced security of the Kadena network, we offer a comprehensive and integrated suite of tools for the entire lifecycle of a token. This cohesive ecosystem ensures a smoother, safer, and more successful journey for projects and investors alike."

Precise Formula:  The smart contract calculates the precise penalty using the formula: Penalty % = 100% - (~0.274% × days_staked) Token Burning:  All tokens collected from penalties are permanently removed from circulation (burned). Immediate Effect:  Early unstaking immediately removes the user from all tier pools and revokes eligibility for any upcoming IDOs. Real-time Updates:  Your personal staking dashboard will always display your current penalty percentage and the net amount of tokens you would receive if you unstaked. Staking Tiers Tier 1: Node Staking Requirement:  50,000 $KPAD IDO Benefit:  A chance to be one of  10 wallets  randomly drawn for an allocation. Tier 2: Cluster Staking Requirement:  150,000 $KPAD IDO Benefit:  A chance to be one of  25 wallets  randomly drawn for an allocation. Tier 3: Chainweb Staking Requirement:  350,000 $KPAD IDO Benefit:   A Guaranteed Allocation  for every project launch. How It Works: The Allocation Draw For every project launch, a set number of allocation spots are reserved for our stakers. The lottery system is straightforward and transparent: Node Tier:  All stakers in this tier are entered into a dedicated draw. For each launch,  10 winning wallets  will be randomly selected from this pool to receive an allocation. Cluster Tier:  All stakers in this tier are entered into their own separate draw. For each launch,  25 winning wallets  will be randomly selected from this pool. Your odds of winning in each tier depend on the total number of participants in that specific tier's pool for each launch. The Chainweb Advantage: Guaranteed Access This is our premium tier for those who want certainty. As a Chainweb staker, you bypass the lottery entirely. You are  guaranteed an allocation  in every single project we launch. The total allocation pool reserved for this tier is divided equally among all Chainweb members, ensuring you never miss an opportunity."

        "title": "Kadpad Absolute Zero",
        "text": "Kadpad Absolute Zero: Our Commitment to Investor Security The \"Kadpad Absolute Zero\" model is the bedrock of our platform. This innovative model was designed by experienced industry members with one primary goal: to create the safest possible environment for our community of investors. It is a non-negotiable set of security and transparency protocols engineered to drastically reduce the chances of \"rug pulls\" and prevent community investments from being liquidated. By enforcing these standards, we aim to build unwavering trust, grow the Kadena community, and bring more people into Web3. Our vision is for this model to become so effective that new projects look to launch with Kadpad's technology as the gold standard for security and integrity. Any project wishing to launch on Kadpad must adhere to every component of this model. There are no exceptions. Pillar 1: Mandatory Team & Business Verification Anonymity can be a shield for bad actors. We remove that shield. Full KYC/KYB:  Every project's core team members must pass a rigorous Know Your Customer (KYC) process. Furthermore, as a registered business entity, Kadpad itself has completed full Know Your Business (KYB) and KYC verification on Kadena.io. Our community is more than welcome to contact the Kadena team directly to verify this. Pillar 2: Rigorous Project & Tokenomics Audit A project must be fundamentally sound before it ever reaches our community. In-Depth Vetting:  We conduct a comprehensive review of the project's goals, roadmap, and marketing strategy to ensure it has a viable plan for long-term success. Tokenomics Review:  Our team analyzes the project's tokenomics to ensure they are fair, sustainable, and structured to prevent manipulation. We work with teams to align their model with our strict guidelines for investor protection. Treasury and Allocation Audit:  We conduct a mandatory audit of the project's treasury and team token allocations. We believe these allocations must not exceed a reasonable percentage of the total supply, a policy designed to prevent the risk of market liquidation from a large sell-off. Pillar 3: Locked Liquidity & Community Funds This is our guarantee against \"rug pulls\" and market manipulation. Managed Presale Contracts:  Our team creates the presale contract for the project owner, enabling a simple \"one-click\" deployment. This direct oversight prevents numerical and dating mistakes, stops dishonest presale setups, and enforces limits on batches per whitelisted wallet. This prevents whales from accumulating a majority of the supply and protects the community from liquidation events. 100% of Raised $KDA is Locked:  Every dollar raised from the community during a sale is immediately and permanently locked as liquidity in the Mercatus Works DEX. This is the community's investment, and our policy dictates that it is not ours to touch. Locked Unsold Tokens:  To prevent market manipulation, any tokens remaining unsold after a launch are also be burned to ensure that the value does not dilute and keeps each launch community focused. Team & Treasury Tokens:  Team tokens are part of the project's overall treasury allocation. While not subject to a vesting schedule, the size of this allocation is strictly controlled by our  Treasury and Allocation Audit  to prevent market instability. By enforcing these three pillars, the \"Kadpad Absolute Zero\" model minimizes risk and ensures that only legitimate, high-quality, and committed projects are presented to our community. Your security is our absolute priority."
